# Template_THREE.js

THREE.js template I've created that will let me construct a scene to quickly test controllers, cameras, materials, textures, 3d objects and lighting.


## Setup
Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Run these following commands:

``` bash
# Install dependencies (only the first time)
npm install

# Run the local server at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# GSAP library for animation timelines
npm install GSAP

# Lil GUI for debuging
npm install lil-gui

# Build for production in the dist/ directory
npm run build
```
